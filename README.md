# compress-images

Image compression using PIL.

## Usage

```bash
$ python3 main.py <path-to-directory>

## TODO

- Check if file is an image
- If the user doesn't have permissions to read/write file, handle
    this exception properly
- Handle png image compression as well
- Prompt user for max resolution
